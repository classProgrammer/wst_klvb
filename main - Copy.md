    - visit page
  - Transactional
    - Download
    - Shop
- Evaluation
  - quality of pages varies
  - Precision
  - Recall
- Crawl
  - Seed URLs from good URL-Hubs
  - good URL = present in many URL-hubs

  - Processing Steps
    - fetch URL (from URL frontier)
    - Fetch the document
    - Parse the URL
      - extract links to other docs/URLs
    - check if content was already seen
      - if not add to indices
    - For each extracted URL
      - check URL => Filter

# Link Analysis
- Web is a graph
  - node = doc/URL
  - edge = link
- ranking
  - citation frequency
  - related docs refer each other
  - pagerank
  - directed = count(inlinks)
  - undirected = count (in- + outlinks)
  - Page Rank Scoring
    - init with long-term visit rate
    - Random Walk web like a user
    - at a dead end jump to a random page
    - 90% go to random outlink
    - 10% jump to random page
  - Nowadays
    - more human way of interaction
    - the whole query is interesting
    - pages matching the meaning do better than pages matching a few words
  - Topic Specific Pagerank
    - can't do at runtime
    - do beforehand for topics
  - Influencing Pagerank 
    - user history
- Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS)
  - good HUB-Pages = good list of links
  - Authority Pages = in many good HUB-Pages
- Base set
  - collection of potentially good hubs or authorities
- Paid Add
  - expensive
  - optimize search engine
  - Spam techniques
    - cloaking
      - serve fake content to spider
